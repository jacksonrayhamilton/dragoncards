Hello Professor Lewis!

To run the project locally, navigate to the root of this project and run the following command:

sh target/bin/webapp

And it should run. However if this doesn't work then you can view the live demo at dragoncards.herokuapp.com

Sorry about the incredible complexity of this project. The meat of the project is in src/main/java/com/herokuapp/dragoncards/, excluding all the encoders and decoders. The client side is in src/main/webapp/js/client.js.
